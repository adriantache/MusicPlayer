_A mock music player app for the Google Nanodegree_

One of the assignments we received in the Google Nanodegree scholarship was to create a music player mockup app in order to test our 
understanding of more complex Android features such as custom Objects, `ArrayAdapters` and working with `ListViews`. I also learned 
about implementing the `OnClickListener` interface, which really simplified things a lot.

**Known issues:**
* The app doesn't actually play music stored on the device, only what's stored inside the app itself, since I haven't yet learned how
to access the file system. I'm sure I could get it done, but I'd rather learn things systematically at first.
